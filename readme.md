Collection of simple, usually relatively basic Python programs I write when bored at school.

List of each one and what they do:\
`calc.py` is a calculator that adds two randomly generated numbers.\
`clock.py` is a working digital clock.\
`cube.py` is a really, really rough attempt to try to visualize a spinning 3D cube.\
`mario.py` shows a sprite of Mario. Usually.\
`mcdays.py` counts an approximation of real life time spent in a Minecraft world.\
`rainbow.py` is a rainbow scroller.\
`scroller.py` is a various assortment of scrollers I've made.\
`shop.py` is a basic shop system. ***This needs `shop_list.py` to work!***\
`shop_list.py` is a list for `shop.py`, separated for easy modification and to not take up too much space on `shop.py`.\
`text_engine.py` is a thing that lets you put text in and get text displayed back in your terminal.\
`textscroller.py` is a text scroller.
